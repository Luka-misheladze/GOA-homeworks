<h2>My favorite foods:</h2>
<h3>pizza</h3>
<p>one of my favorite foods pizza making typically involves preparing dough, applying sauce and toppings, and then baking it until the crust is cooked and the cheese is melted. The process can be simplified by using pre-made pizza dough or even just a pre-made pizza crust.</p>

<h3>mwvadi</h3>

<p>also my favorite food Georgian barbeque can be made from pork and  veal as well, yet pork mtsvadi is more popular. If you prepare mtsvadi with this kind of marinade, you will end up eating most tender and juicy barbeque ever.</p>
