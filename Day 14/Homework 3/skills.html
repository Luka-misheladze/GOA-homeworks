                    <p>
                        Hey there! I’m a teenage web developer who’s super into building websites from scratch using just <span class="orange">HTML</span> and <span class="blue">CSS</span> (yup, no fancy frameworks yet 😎). I started learning web dev because I was curious how websites actually work, and now I’m hooked.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I love making things look clean and modern, and experimenting with different styles until everything just clicks. Whether it’s a personal portfolio, a landing page, or some random idea I dreamed up at <span class="red">2 AM</span>—I'm always coding something.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I’m still learning more every day, trying to level up my skills and make cooler designs. I believe design should feel good and look awesome on any screen. Right now I’m focused on mastering the front-end basics before jumping into <span class="yellow">JavaScript</span>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Outside of coding, I love <span class="darkblue">chill music 🎵</span>, late-night design sessions, and making my friends say “whoa” when they see my websites. I’m all about improving, exploring new ideas, and having fun while doing it. Let’s create something cool together! 🚀✨
