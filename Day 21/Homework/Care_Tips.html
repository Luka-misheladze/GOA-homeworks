                        <a class="hamster-housing-a-tag" href="">Hamster housing</a> should provide at least a 15-20 gallon cage, with at <br>
                        least 150 square inches of solid (not wire) floor space, but bigger is <br>
                        always better. Wire cages, aquariums, and plastic habitats can be used <br>
                        as long as they provide a safe, escape-proof home for your hamster- <br> hamsters are escape artists!

                    <p>
                        Housing must be well-ventilated to allow fresh air; this prevents buildup <br>
                        of odor from urine, feces, and spoiled food. Hamsters, with few <br>
                        exceptions, should always be housed alone, as they canbe fiercely <br>
                        territorial and cause a great deal of damage to each other through <br>
                        fighting.

                    Preferred cage temperatures are 65-80 degrees Fahrenheit, <br>
                    with relative humidity around 40-70%. In temperatures below 40 degrees <br>
                    Fahrenheit, hamsters can go inot a state of torpor, which is similar to <br>
                    hibernation.

                    Annual veterinary visits are essential to maintaining your hamster's <br>
                    health. Your vet will perform a thorough exam, record your hamster's <br>
                    weight, check for dental disease, and review diet and husbandry. They <br>
                    can also assist in trimming nails and catching medical problems early.

                    <p>
                        Hamsters do very well on commercial <a href="">diets</a>, pellets, or blocks, <br>
                        containing around 16% protein. <a href="">Oxbow</a> and <a href="">Kaytee</a> are preferred pellet <br>
                        or block brands that hamsters thrive on. Work with your veterinarian to <br>
                        determine your hamster's caloric needs based on their size and health, <br>
                        but most hamsters require ⅛-⅓ cup of pellets per day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hamsters can be supplemented with additional fruits and vegetables, <br>
                        but these foods should not be not be the mainstay of their diet.
